# KidNeYronal

This is an implementation of KidNeYronal-CNN using Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates 3 pHe compartment predictions from hyperpolarized zymonic acid spectra obtained in MRI of mixed (synthetic + acquired) data set of acquisitions from the kidneys of healthy mice.

The repository includes:

•	Training source code for KidNeYronal-CNN in Jupyter notebooks

•	Pre-trained weights for KidNeYronal-CNN

•	Training, Validation and test data sets (synthetic + acquired)
