# KidNeYronal

This is an implementation of KidNeYronal-CNN using Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates 3 pHe compartment predictions from hyperpolarized zymonic acid spectra obtained in MRI of mixed (synthetic + acquired) data set of acquisitions from the kidneys of healthy mice.

The repository includes:

1. Code: 

- Training code for KidNeYronal in Jupyter notebooks
  -	CNN with mixed data (Mix) and with synthetic data (S)
  -	MLP with mixed data (Mix) and with synthetic data (S)

- Line-fitting analysis code

2. Data:

-	Training, validation and test data sets (synthetic + acquired)
- Healthy mice kidney imaging data and ROI
