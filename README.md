# KidNeYronal

This is an implementation of KidNeYronal-CNN using Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates 3 pHe compartment predictions from hyperpolarized zymonic acid spectra obtained in MRI of mixed (synthetic + acquired) data set of acquisitions from the kidneys of healthy mice.

The repository includes:

Code: 

- Training code for KidNeYronal in Jupyter notebooks

•	CNN with mixed data and with synthetic data
•	MLP with mixed data and with synthetic data

- Line-Fitting Analysis code

Data:

-	Training, Validation and test data sets (synthetic + acquired)

Others:

-	Pre-trained weights for 4 KidNeYronal models
